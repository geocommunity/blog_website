This workshop  broadly covered remote sensing data analysis using the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) (ODC), developed by Geoscience Australia. We went over some important Python packages that the ODC is built upon: [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/), and [Dask](https://dask.org/), and explored how they enable fast and scalable computation. 

All the learning material used in this tutorial is available on the Digital Earth Australia Sandbox as Jupyter Notebooks. <strong>An account was required to participate</strong>, which can easily be created [here](https://app.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F). 

Additional documentation for the DEA Sandbox is available [here](https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/index.html) which includes useful guides, a dataset catalogue and examples. 


If you missed the demonstration, the recording is available on our cloudstor site, email mitchel.rudge@uq.edu.au to get access.
