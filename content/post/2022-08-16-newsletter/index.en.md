# UQ geospatial CoP Newsletter for August 2022

## Blog post – Interactive mapping with Rshiny, Christina Buelow
A huge thanks to Christina for the interactive mapping with RShiny workshop.  All the material is available [here](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/post/2022-07-20-intro-interactive-mapping-rshiny/). There was a lot of interest in the subject of interactive maps, and talk of a follow up session. Christina is very knowledgeable on all thing R-spatial, and would be happy to help if you are stuck trying to make a web map. 

## Next workshop - Analysing climate data with R, Ralph Trancoso
We have [another great workshop is lined up](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/upcoming-events/). Ralph Trancoso is going to show us how to delve into climate data - both observations and projections - using R. If you want to include climate data in your research but don’t know where to start, you really won’t want to miss this one!
