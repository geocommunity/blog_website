# UQ geospatial CoP Newsletter for September 2022

## Blog post – Analysing climate data with R, Ralph Trancoso 
Last Thursday Ralph ran us through the basics of climate analysis in R. This was a really informative workshop that demystified climate data. All the scripts are now up [on the blog](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/post/2022-09-01-analysing-climate-data-with-r/), as well as a link to the materials. If you missed the workshop, the recording is up on cloudstor (let me know if you don’t have access). 

## Problem solving session
Our next workshop will be a free-range problem-solving session. So, if you have any questions or issues you think someone in the community could help with, please bring them along.  

## Conference in Fiji
You heard right! [The Pacific Geospatial Conference](https://foss4g-oceania.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=26f3c80da46835144592b59b6&id=68cc00705a&e=39ddba9ecb) will be held in Suva, Fiji from the 28th of November till 2nd December. [Here is the Conference Program](https://foss4g-oceania.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=26f3c80da46835144592b59b6&id=ba3c27a111&e=39ddba9ecb). By all reports this is an excellent conference that would be interesting to members of this community. 

## UQ Library update – QGIS Custom maps on your phone
The UQ library will be hosting a [QGIS: Custom Maps on your Phone](https://studenthub.uq.edu.au/students/events/detail/4134599)
workshop on Thursday 22 September 2022, 9.30am - 11.30am. 

This session is split into two main sections. First it will cover useful spatial data portals (freely accessing aerial photography, government spatial data, quality digital elevation models, and more), and then it will cover how to package this data for use in the field on a mobile phone.
