# UQ geospatial CoP Newsletter for July 2022


## Latest blog post
We have put together a [summary of last week’s workshop](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/post/2022-07-07-problem-solving-session-ii/). 

Thanks to everyone who had questions, answers, and contributions. It should all be captured in the post now. If you would like me to make any edits to the post, or better still if there are development on the problems, please let me know and I can easily update the details. 

## Advanced data wrangling for spatial analysis in R this Friday (TOMORROW)
Christina Buelow from Griffith will be hosting this 1-day course. It will be extremely useful whether you are relatively new to geospatial in R, or looking to hone your skills.  https://smp.uq.edu.au/event/session/11370
Cost is $150 for students (hopefully there are still spots available) 

## Interactive maps in Rshiny 
Christina will also be hosting a 100% free [Mapping interactively with Rshiny workshop](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/upcoming-events/) later in the month. Please spread the word, this is sure to be an excellent use of time if you have ever thought about putting your maps and data online. 

## Advanced R workshop with Bill Venables

Advanced R workshop with Bill Venables
The advanced R workshop with Bill Venables was cancelled but he is doing it for free over several weeks 1 hr on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.   
If you’re interested, email roxanne.jemison@uq.edu.au who is organising it.

## R for Ecologists. 
EcoCommons, who are creating a platform for digital modelling and analysis (read more here https://www.ecocommons.org.au/about/), have a new educational package: R for Ecologists (https://www.ecocommons.org.au/educational-material/). 
This is based on this data carpentry module. All videos are 100% free on youtube, and include plenty of spatial content including species distribution modelling. 

## Organising committee
We are putting together an organising committee to help coordinate workshops, this newsletter, and any other new ideas we might have. If you would be interested in volunteering a small amount of time, please get in touch.
