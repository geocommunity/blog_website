title: About us

Whether its making a simple site map or running deep learning analyses on satellite data, students and researchers are often called upon to conduct geospatial analysis. :world_map:

Fortunately, there a wealth of freely available tools can help to complete these tasks: think R, Python and QGIS.:hammer:

Unfortunately, a steep learning curve is often required to apply these tools, particularly when we don't all have a strong background in coding, GIS or remote sensing.

The **Brisbane Geospatial Analysis Community of Practice** (take the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyIqFRi1ySR0z0d7u0lSmXu1Vt5_wRq-0aD5bUCml8VziUGQ/viewform) to choose a new name!) tries to make this process a bit less painful, by sharing our experiences, skills and tricks in a friendly and inclusive environment. :woman_technologist: We run monthly skill sharing tutorial sessions where a member of the community teaches us something they have learned along the way.

This usually occurs on the last Thursday of each month. See [upcoming events](/upcoming-events/) for the next session and check out our [blog](/post/) for previous sessions.
