# What’s new with S2?

If you use R for spatial analysis, you may be aware of the new S2 geometry library. What’s the big deal? What does it mean if I’m calculating area or distances in R?

We’ll get into this and some workflows for accurately calculating area in R. (Sounds trivial, but actually there can be a lot of decisions to make - e.g., should I project my data, or shouldn’t I?)

Read the notes we'll go through [here](https://cabuelow.quarto.pub/calculating-areas-with-vector-and-raster-data-in-r/).

If we have time in the session, we can also do some problem solving. So give me a shout if have any burning spatial questions in particular: ([c.buelow\@griffith.edu.au](mailto:c.buelow@griffith.edu.au)) 

## **When** Thursday 9th February, 2:00 - 4:00pm
